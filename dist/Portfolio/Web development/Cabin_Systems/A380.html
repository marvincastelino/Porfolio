          <div class="panel-body">
            <strong>Crew Work Station (CWS)</strong>
            <p>It is a designated stowage location for a variety of inflight tools that all cabin crew may need to use at some stage during the flight.
              <ul>
                <li>A Crew Management Terminal (CMT) is located inside the CWS and thus, the inflight Entertainment System (IFE) is operated from this location.</li>
                <li>It features an L shaped table and seat for in flight administration duties</li>
                <li>The external door and internal stowage are lockable, so it is an ideal location to stow flight documentation and precious cargo</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Guideline for the use of the CWS:
              <ul>
                <li>The CWS door should be locked by the handle and <b>NOT</b> by the key</li>
                <li>The CWS is the dedicated precious cargo stowage</li>
                <li>The CWS cannot be occupied during taxi, take-off and landing and in cases of turbulence when the captain requests cabin crew to take their jump seats (the seat is not certified for use during these times)</li>
                <li>Take care when taking food and beverages into the CWS, to avoid damage to the electronic equipment</li>
                <li>Purser to ensure periods of rest time are not spent in the CWS – it is not a rest area</li>
                <li>Under no circumstances can the CWS be used to stow large baggage, baby strollers or musical instruments at any phase of the flight</li>
                <li>No customers are allowed to enter the CWS</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>CWS MAIN POWER
              <ul>
                <li>This switch controls the power to the CWS and all its components. It should always be ON unless there is an emergency.</li>                
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>PED OUTLET AND STOWAGE OUTLET UNIT
              <ul>
                <li>This switch controls the power provided by two external electrical outlets one of which is located in the CWS outer-side stowage area.</li> 
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>CWS OVERHEAD LIGHTING 
              <ul>
                <li>It is a lighting control switch with 3 settings: BRIGHT, DIM, and OFF.</li>               
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>RECHARGE OUTLET
              <ul>
                <li>A 110V, 60Hz charging outlet to be used with KIS devices, i.e. tablet and printer.</li>               
              </ul>
            </p>
             <p>STOWAGE OUTLET UNIT IN USE INDICATOR 
              <ul>
                <li>This is an indicator light which comes ON when the external stowage outlet in being used.</li>               
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The CMT's main purpose is to run the IFE management software which allows the crew to control and check various IFE functions. On its right hand side, the CMT has a card reader which is used by the crew to sign in to the system by swiping their ID card. It is also used for reading Credit Card information.
            </p>
            <p>IFE Printer
              <ul>
                <li>The IFE Printer can be used to print various system related information. Currently, there is no requirement to use the IFE printer. Future systems such as electronic documentation and electronic logbook will allow the crew to print selected information. More details on how the printer is used will be added to this section as and when the requirement to use the printer arises.</li>
              </ul>  
            </p>
            <p>DVD Player
              <ul>
                <li>The DVD Player has become a standard aircraft component used to play various cabin video PAs which might have not been loaded onto the IFE system and are available only on DVDs. Using the DVD Player is similar to using any consumer DVD player, and the buttons EJECT, PLAY, PAUSE, STOP, SKIP to next and SKIP to previous operates as expected. In addition there are the following light indicators.</li>
                <li>DISC IN – will stay on as long as there is a disc in the player.</li>
                <li>POWER – will stay on as long as there is power to the player.</li>
                <li>ERROR DISC – will come on when the player encounters an error while reading the disc (wrong disc type or disc loaded upside down) .</li>
                <li>EWCP – Early Window Content Protection – only when it is flashing does it mean that error has been detected.</li>
              </ul>  
            </p>
             <p>Other Components
              <ul>
                <li>CIDS Handset - used to communicate between the CWS and other cabin stations including the cockpit.</li>
                <li>IFE Handset - provides means to make a phone call to ground as in calling MEDLINK.</li>
                <li>AIP - CIDS calls and emergency related indicators.</li>
              </ul>  
            </p>
             <p>Troubleshooting
              <ul>
                <li>When the pursers board the aircraft they should check that the CWS components are operational, particularly the CMT. Any defective component at this stage must be reported to the ground engineers for repair.</li>
                <li>With the exception of the CMT if any other component becomes defective during the flight then it should be logged as a defect.</li>
                <li>If the CMT fails during the flight then it can be reset from the IFE Power page on the FAP. More information on resetting the CMT can be found in the IFE Power section under Cabin Systems. If the CMT could not be recovered then the CP could be used instead. The two CP's at UR1 and UR3 has the same functionality as the CMT but neither has a card reader.</li>
                <li>If there is an emergency involving electrical components in the CWS then the power to the CWS must be turned off using the CWS MAIN POWER switch.</li>
              </ul>

                    <strong>FAP</strong>
                      <p>FAP has two operating modes which can be toggled using the CIDS and MENU keys located immediately under the touch screen. [MENU] provides access to the applications loaded on the A380 Server System, which includes:
                        <li>CVMS (Cabin Video Monitoring System)</li>
                        <li>Connectivity</li>
                      </p>
                      <p>Cabin Video Monitoring System – CVMS : Operation
                        <ol>
                          <li>Access the Application Menu on the FAP by using the MENU (hard) button.</li>
                          <li>Select button on the CVMS panel launches the application.</li>
                          <li>Select Crew type of access.</li>
                          <li>CVMS then requests that the user provides a password to access the application. This is a precautionary measure to prevent accidental access to the CVMS by unauthorized personnel. The password is a four digit number which can be entered using the number pad displayed on the screen. The last record of passwords which provide access to the CVMS includes: 5712, 5716, and 8841.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>
                    <small>Note:
                      <p>
                        The intended purpose of the CVMS can only be applied if the system is capable or recording. Since this feature is not yet implemented in the software, the application is not officially available for use. If the senior crew wishes to use the application they can do so only to monitor the progress of a service and the activity of the cabin crew during the service. Since the customers are not informed of the availability of the monitoring system, other usage could have legal implications. Therefore using the CVMS should be done discretely and only if necessary.
                      </p> 
                      <p>[CIDS] provides access to the cabin functions mode.  There are two set of functions available which allow the crew to controls the cabin environment and hence its ambiance. The extended set includes additional functions to configure and adjust various application settings. Crew can only access the standard function set. The extended set is reserved for the engineers and maintenance.

                        <li>If any error occurs with the Shower Control Page on the FAP the system will generate an error message and the [CAUT] button will start flashing. Pressing the [CAUT] button will provide more details on the error on the system page. If the problem cannot be fixed it must be logged as a defect. If an error related to the heating of the water occurs the heaters page on the FAP must be accessed and the water heater pad of the shower checked. The [On/Off] button should be on. In case of a fault the reset button can be pressed. If the fault is not rectified then the fault must be logged as a defect.</li>

                    <p><strong>IFE Power</strong></br>
                        The IFE Power function provides another troubleshooting option for the IFE where by it can reset (turn Off then On again) a group of seat collectively. It also provides means to shut down/reset particular IFE CMT Station. Due to the impact this function might have on the IFE in the cabin, its page has been protected by a password to prevent its accidental use. The password though is the same one used to activate the FAP, which is “686”. The main deck page includes a similar layout of the IFE zones with their respective On/OFF buttons and the additional IFE related components which includes:

                    <p><strong>Galley Cooling & Chillers Control</strong></br>
                        The Galley Cooling function does not perform any task which requires that it be used by the crew. However, it can serve as a monitor to check all the chilled galleys and detect if there is any fault in any. The indicator is divided into two parts: FAULT, and TEMP. WARNING. The indicator illuminates red when one of the following two situations occur: The expected cooling/chilling temperature has not been reached 80 min after turning on the chiller. In this case the lower half of the indicator illuminates (TEMP. WARNING). This could be the result of the crew leaving the doors of the chilled comportments open too long, preventing the chilling from reaching its intended temperature. The temp. is then checked every 20 min. If the chilling temp. is reached the indicator light goes off. If the ACU (Air Conditioning Unit) in this particular area is faulty, the FAULT part of the indicator illuminates. There is no immediate reason why an ACU in a particular galley might fail. However, the senior crew can further investigate by checking the Galley Cooling Page on the FAP.
                        <small>Note: The Galley Cooling function cannot be used to fix any fault reported in any of the galleys; it can only provide messages which might indicate a fault. This information can be useful for the engineers when trying to fix ACU related problems.</small>

                <strong>Shower Control Page</strong></br>
                The Shower Control Page includes a control panel for each shower unit [Shower Time Settings] panel, a [Water Quantity] panel and a [Water Quantity Indicator] panel.  The values of the Shower Time Settings and Water Quantity must NOT be changed (they must read 5 min for water time and 1 min for timeout). The time out warning is the time when a warning is activated in the shower to indicate to the customer that the water is about to run out. If it is set to one minute then the warning begins one minute before the water ends.
                <p>
                <strong>Operation</strong>    
                <ul>
                  <li>Before turning the shower units ON the crew must check with the ground maintenance/engineers if work on the waste and water tanks has been completed. Activating the showers while water tanks are being filled/emptied has resulted in the shower malfunctioning after take-off.</li>
                  <li>[ON] - pre-heating process which lasts for approx. 15 min. The pre-heating process occurs only once when the showers are first turned ON. Any pre-heating that occurs during the flight between shower uses lasts approx. 5 min.</li>
                  <li>[READY FOR USE] indicates that the shower unit is ready to be used by the customers. The panel also includes a time line indicator which gets filled with a blue and amber line. When the shower is in use the blue bar indicator gradually shrink as water gets dispersed. When the amber area (last 1 min) is reached, the warning inside the shower is activated. When the last minute is reached, the water inside the shower stops flowing. The gage inside the shower reflects that there is a one minute left of water usage. The customer has to press the water flow knob to receive 10 seconds worth of water. This process is repeated until the one minute of water is used up (6 x 10 seconds disperses).</li>
                  <li>After each usage the CSA cleans the shower unit. Before entering the shower the CSA must press the [Clean Mode] button to get 30 seconds of water (3 x 10 seconds disperses) to clean the unit with. Once done, the CSA must press on the [Reset] button before the shower can be used by the next customer.</li>
                </ul> 
                </p>
                <p><small>Note:
                  <li>The clean mode allows the CSA to use the shower water while the shower door is open. If the customer attempts to open the door while showering the water immediately stops. Water will not flow until the door is closed. Inform the learners the current slide shows the indicator and the shower handset inside the shower unit.</li></small>
                </p>  
                <p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></br>
                  <li>If any error occurs with the Shower Control Page on the FAP the system will generate an error message and the [CAUT] button will start flashing. Pressing the [CAUT] button will provide more details on the error on the system page.Sometimes if the shower poses problems with dispersing water, using the clean mode a couple of times along with resetting the Shower Heaters have fixed the problem. There are no guarantees that this works in all cases though.If any of the CIDS cabin functions, FAPs or MFAPs fail inform the Flight Crew. If the issue is not fixed send an LICCC message to ground and follow any instructions received.If the issue still not fixed, log it in the Cabin/IFE Defect Log Book and write a KIS report.</li>
