          <p> Yes, if the flight is 3 hours and above. For flights under 3 hours it is left to the Purser’s discretion.</p>
          <p><i><strong>More:</strong> Flights less than 3 hours will not benefit from the use of Mood Lighting especially if the flight occurs during day time where any effect of mood lighting is barely visible. However, you can use it if you feel that it adds or improves on the ambiance of the cabin especially at night or during day/night transition. For flights longer than 3 hours there is time to play at least one scenario. For long haul flights full use of mood lighting is required and should include the use of SUNSET and SUNRISE scenarios.</i>

                      <p>Follow these simple guidelines: 
                        <ul>
                          <li>Run SUNRISE prior to a main meal service, if the cabin is dark</li>
                          <li>Run SUNSET prior to the end of a main meal service if there is enough time for customers to sleep</li>
                          <li>Run SUNRISE prior to top of descent if the cabin is dark</li>                         
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        <i><strong>More:</strong> The best way to understand this is to adapt the normal approach to lighting as if there is no Mood Lighting. Normally we would offer our customers the chance to sleep after a main meal service regardless of the time of the day and just by assessing the customers’ mood. If there is no Mood Lighting, we try to lower the shades and put off the lights. If there is Mood Lighting, just replace “put off the lights” with “run the sunset scenario”, taking into consideration the scenario needs to be turned on a bit earlier so that it is half way by the time you finish the service.</br>The same concept applies for waking up customer for a service. If there is no mood lighting, we simply put the lights ON (though not to full brightness as it can be very disturbing sleeping customers) just a few minutes before the service starts. If there is Mood Lighting, replace “put the lights ON” with “run the sunrise scenario”. Again, the scenario needs to be run a bit earlier so that by the time the service begins the scenario is half way with enough light in the cabin for all to see clearly.</i>

            <p>In general there are only two main scenarios, SUNSET to dim the cabin, and SUNRISE to bring the cabin into full brightness. At least one should be used on short flights and both on longer flights.</p>
            <p><i><strong>More:</strong> On the B777 select either SUNRISE or SUNSET and run the scenario. SUNSET on the B777 goes into night with stars. Some older B777 need you to select SUNSET with STARS for the stars to appear.On the A380, one additional scenario must be run after SUNSET for the cabin to go into darkness and stars to appear. This scenario is called NIGHT. Therefore, on the A380 always run SUNSET followed by NIGHT.</i>

               <p>Yes. The day time or brightness outside the aircraft has little impact on customers travel state.</p>
            <p><i><strong>More:</strong> Many of our flights take off in the morning and we still, after the first meal service, try to lower the shades and allow our customers to sleep. Most of our customers are actually connections from other flights and most would like to sleep even on morning flights. The preferred option is to actually evaluate the state of your customers in the cabin. If the majority look tired then it is safe to assume that they are transit customers and would benefit from a bit of sleep.</i>

             <p>Yes. Scenarios are not only to encourage customers to sleep. They are a cabin feature improving the cabin ambience.</p>
            <p><i><strong>More:</strong> If most of the customers are awake and not likely to sleep, you can run the SUNSET scenario and just before it gets too dark hold/pause the scenario. Customers can still enjoy the coloured lighting transition before the scenario is paused with just enough light for all to see clearly. Later the scenario can either be allowed to continue or cancelled with another to make the cabin brighter.</i>

               <p>The Cabin Crew Service Manual includes a section under Cabin Systems which covers how to operate Mood Lighting. Mood Lighting training is covered in the Cabin Supervisor and Purser promotional courses. Additional training can be provided on request.</p>
            <p><i><strong>More:</strong> The operational instruction in the manual only explains how scenarios are activated in the cabin. They do not provide instruction as to when and which scenario to select. To know when and which scenario to run requires analysis of the flight and customers to determine what best suit their status and meal services that must be performed. The same applies to the training which covers how Mood Lighting operates but also studies various examples of how it can be used. It provides some guidelines which can be followed but nothing is set as a fixed procedure.</i></p>
            <p>To attend additional Mood Lighting training sessions contact the training college and arrange timings with the IT training team, headed by Mr. Mazen Wehbe, under Service Training. </p>

               <p>There are a lot of variable factors which determine when and which scenario to play.  Leaders should use their judgment in deciding what would be best for customers.</p>
            <p><i><strong>More:</strong> As mentioned earlier, the senior has to analyze the cabin status before determining when and which scenario to run and how. If we are to create a fixed procedure for each flight, then it would be different for each and every variation of the same destination. For example, we would have a different procedure for each of the LHRs that go out on the same day. Such variation in a procedure can be very hard to maintain. Second, the customers’ wellbeing is no longer considered if procedures are set.  This would certainly end with us causing our customers annoyance by forcing a particular lighting status just because it is part of the procedure. The element of freedom must be maintained if we are to provide our customers with the best experience. For example, seniors should have the freedom to run the SUNSET scenario and then hold/pause it before the cabin goes dark if they observe that most of the customers in the cabin are awake and would benefit more from having dim lighting instead of full darkness.</i></p>
